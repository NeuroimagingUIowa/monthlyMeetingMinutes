## 2018 November

## 2018 October
- Mark Bowren delivered an explanation of [LESYMAP](https://github.com/dorianps/LESYMAP) and associated tutorial (to be uploaded) to try it out for yourself.

## 2018 September
- No meeting, but we distributed a paper about [good spreadsheet organizational practices]( https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) and encouraged people to sign up
for the [uiowa hackathon](https://bigdata.uiowa.edu/)

## 2018 August
- Dr. Merry Mani graciously gave a [diffusion imaging tutorial using FSL](https://github.com/NeuroimagingUIowa/dwiProcessingTutorial)

## 2018 July
- [cron tutorial](https://slides.com/jameskent/cron#/) (James Kent)

## 2018 June
- Dr. Tim Koscik gave a great tutorial about doing some basic [neuroimaging analysis using R](data/2018-06-29_tim-koscik_r-neuroimaging.html). (loading data in/performing basic modelling, etc) 
**Note**: you need to download the `html` file and open it with your browser to see the contents

## 2018 May
- Brief remarks about the brainhack and brainstorming about other training opportunities (Jatin has a cool idea!)
- Pro/Cons of having a central repository (probably on Github) to place shareable scripts at uiowa (like the T1rho analysis scripts?)
- See what we would like to learn about over the summer (e.g. if other people would like to lead discussion and teach us about something they are working on)

## 2018 April
- introductions (if there are new people)
- [fmriprep preprint is out](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/25/306951)
- [honorable mention](http://neuroinformatics2017.org/speakers/chris-gorgolewski/)
- [reproin intro](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproin)
- [xnat_downloader demo](https://github.com/HBClab/xnat_downloader)
- Can we use/improve dcm2niix to support more BIDS fields or should we focus on our own tools?

## 2018 March
